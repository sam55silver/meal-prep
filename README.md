# Meal Prep Service

An AI service to redefine home cooking for fitness enthusiasts. 

Currently people who meal prep 
    1. Take a lot of time to build plans with their macro nutrition needs.
    2. Resort to bland, raw recipes. 

An AI kitchen helper would be a game changer to speed up the meal plan process and provide much more creative meals.
